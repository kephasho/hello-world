# hello-world
just another respository
Hi there, i am dennis a.k.a comp guy. i got the name because i was so good in computer hardware, in installing of computer games playing them to pro levels even i became more sophisicated to a point of installing operating sytems, something only engeneers at that time only did. i knew i had a little knowldege when it came to real computer programming. over the years i have been dormant, but had the passion just within me. Now i think i need to unleash it and follow the dream i once had to be best in what i do that is in computer programing.
My dream in life is to be good in programming so that i can teach others.
